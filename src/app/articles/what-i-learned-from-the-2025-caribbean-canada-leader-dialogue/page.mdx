## Introduction: A Leadership Journey That Was Anything but Ordinary

Sometimes, we attend events that check a box. And sometimes, we participate in something that fundamentally shifts the way we see ourselves, others, and the world around us.

The 2025 Caribbean Canada Leaders Dialogue (CCLD) was definitely the latter—a dynamic experience that challenged me intellectually, emotionally, and interpersonally. I went in expecting panels and networking opportunities. I walked away with a deeper understanding of inclusive leadership, cross-cultural collaboration, and the socioeconomic intricacies that shape the Caribbean region.

In this article, I want to unpack what the CCLD is about, highlight the unexpected lessons I learned, and share how it’s already changing how I show up in my work and my life.

## What Is the CCLD?

The Caribbean Canada Leaders Dialogue is a cross-sectoral exchange program designed to foster leadership, social innovation, and stronger partnerships between Canada and the Caribbean.

Created under the patronage of the Duke of Edinburgh and organized in partnership with institutions across both regions, the program brings together emerging and established leaders from government, civil society, academia, industry, and labor organizations. But what truly sets it apart is its mission: to cultivate deeper human relationships beyond the seats we occupy.

The goal isn’t merely to build skills or transfer knowledge—it’s to connect people on a human level. By doing so, the hope is that we become more compassionate, emotionally intelligent, and culturally attuned as decision-makers. The Duke believed that transformative leadership begins by seeing the humanity in one another—and that’s a belief this program put into practice at every turn.

## What Made It So Special?

What struck me most about CCLD wasn’t the content—it was the people. I had never experienced the Caribbean like this. I met individuals from countries I hadn’t previously engaged with closely, and from walks of life that expanded my understanding of leadership.

We had academics, policymakers, entrepreneurs, civil servants, and grassroots organizers all in one room—not as panelists and audience, but as equals in conversation. Hearing from leaders tackling issues like disaster relief, healthcare access, environmental protection, and labor equity gave me a renewed sense of urgency and purpose.

It’s rare to be part of a group where the shared goal is not to outshine one another, but to deeply connect, collaborate, and co-create sustainable change. CCLD intentionally created that space, and it was powerful.

## A Program Built for Adaptability (And Maybe a Bit of Chaos)

One thing we learned fast: the program was tightly packed. There was no downtime, no buffer, and definitely no space set aside for working on our final presentations. That might sound like poor planning—but it was by design.

Delays, cancellations, missing buses, not receiving our itinerary until hours after arriving—these were not administrative errors. They were intentional variables introduced to test our patience, emotional regulation, and adaptability.

At the time, I’ll admit, I was frustrated. But in hindsight, I see what CCLD was doing. It mimicked the uncertainties of real-world leadership: the unpredictability, the curveballs, the need to solve problems under pressure, and the emotional fatigue that can come when you’re being pulled in multiple directions with very little guidance.

It was an opportunity to reflect on how we show up when nothing is going according to plan.

## Lessons from the Study Tours: Doing Good Can (and Should) Be Profitable

One of the most impactful parts of the program were the site visits and conversations with people on the ground doing meaningful work. One story that stayed with me was from a sand quarry site that had begun an environmental reclamation effort.

The land that was once mined and eroded is now being turned into a wildlife sanctuary and community farm. Not through a massive corporate donation or government intervention—but through a deliberate, creative effort to leave the land better than they found it.

This is the kind of leadership we need more of:

- **Creative restoration** that doesn’t just mitigate harm, but reimagines what reclamation can look like.
- **Economic sustainability** baked into the mission so doing good isn’t an expense, but part of the value chain.

This example made it clear: when we destroy something, we have a responsibility to build something better in return. Not necessarily in function—but in value.

It shouldn't be revolutionary to think that every resource-extractive project should have a restorative counterpart. What would it look like if governments required this of corporations? What if we structured businesses to support environmental or social legacies as a standard, not an exception?

The lesson is simple: doing good shouldn’t be charity. It should be smart business—and the leadership challenge is figuring out how to engineer that reality everywhere we can.

## What I Learned About Leadership From the Experience

### 1. Compassion and Inclusion as Strategy

Being a “good leader” is not just about getting results. It’s about creating spaces where everyone feels heard, valued, and part of the solution. Inclusive leadership requires intention:

- Holding space for diverse voices
- Acknowledging conflict and naming it
- Seeking alignment, not just consensus

There’s a world of difference between “everyone gets a vote” and “everyone gets heard.” And sometimes, democracy is messy—or even unwise. In one group deliberation, I saw firsthand how majority consensus can lead to decisions that, while popular, may not be strategic or well-informed.

Leadership isn’t about always leaning into consensus—it’s about discerning when to guide, when to step aside, and when to challenge the prevailing wisdom.

### 2. Bonding Before Performing

Our team was the largest group in the dialogue—16 people—a size that promised chaos. But by the end, we were the most closely knit group in the program. Why?

Because we made time to bond first.

We created space for laughter, side conversations, dancing, storytelling, and dinner chats. And that psychological safety carried through to our presentation, where we received genuine feedback about how cohesive and warm our dynamic was.

Yes, bonding was accelerated by surprise bus delays, canceled meetings, and a few late-night rum sessions—but the real glue was the commitment to create an inclusive space where everyone could belong.

### 3. Communication Is More Than Content

Another recurring theme was how we communicated. It wasn’t just about having ideas, but about practicing clarity, respect, and timing.

As someone who loves to dig into the philosophical and structural side of things, I initially struggled with our group’s desire for efficiency over depth. At one point, I realized that my usual debate-heavy style wasn’t welcome—it slowed us down.

So I pivoted. I learned to participate more concisely, and sometimes even let go of ideas that weren’t resonating with the group. That wasn’t easy for me. But I realized that leadership also means knowing when you’re helping—and when you’re not.

A quote that stuck with me came from our team lead, Cara Lambee:

> “We all have skills we need to refine. Some of us need to speak more. Others—like you—need to speak less.”

It landed. And I appreciated the honesty.

## Final Reflections: How This Changed Me

This experience didn’t just give me a new appreciation for Caribbean leadership—it gave me a mirror to reflect on how I lead, communicate, and operate.

### What I’m Taking With Me:

- **A Newfound Love for the Caribbean:** Breadfruit, rum, and all. But more than just tastes and sounds, a true appreciation for the people, complexity, resilience, and potential of the region.
- **The Tension Between Perfection and Execution:** I love deep thinking and first principles. But sometimes, teams just need to ship the work. “Good enough” exists for a reason.
- **Letting Go of Control:** Not everything is mine to fix. Sometimes, the act of not stepping in is the right kind of leadership.
- **Balancing Financial Viability with Social Good:** You can’t fund the change you want to see if you don’t have fuel. We need models that support making an impact sustainably—and that includes supportive policy, business incentives, and funding architecture.

## Closing Thought:

I didn’t walk away with a certificate that says I’m a better leader now. But I did walk away more accountable, more aware, and more inspired to find ways to lead with integrity, inclusivity, and impact.

Because that’s what leadership really is. Not control, not charisma, not accomplishment. Leadership is connection.

And the 2025 CCLD built that—one conversation, crisis, and cup of rum at a time.
